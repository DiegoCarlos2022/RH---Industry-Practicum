# RH---Industry-Practicum
Working with an undisclosed industry leader in the high-end home-furnishing industry, we modeled and forecasted ocean shipping volume by individual shipping lane for the furniture that our sponsor has imported into the United States on a month basis. This model and forecast will be used in the future by decision makers to stipulate the shipping volume that they need their partner carriers to import from Asia into the United States by lane. This forecast will mitigate the amount of risk our client is exposed to when negotiating shipping contracts with the ocean carriers that transport their products. Producing a robust model that can accurately predict future shipping volume is vital to our client because, prior to our work, they had no point of reference as to the amount of lane-wise shipping volume to expect each month. We used ARIMA and ETS models on the past seven years of lane-wise monthly shipping volume data to build a forecast for the next twelve months. We were able to effectively model the company's largest lanes by aggregate volume, which accounted for 65% of the total shipping volume our sponsor has imported in the past seven fiscal years. We chose the ARIMA and ETS models in R because of their high performance and ease of replicability over data of different shipping lanes.
